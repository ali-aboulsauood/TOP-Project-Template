# The Odin Project (TOP) - New Project Template

A template repository for projects created with [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com).

**NOTE**:

This is **not** the template README file. The template README file can be found at [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
<br>
In your new repository, GitHub will automatically show the README file under its `docs` directory as the repository's README file, provided that there is no README file under the directories `.github` and/or the root directory of the repository, meaning that you will have to remove this README file from the any repository created from this one.

> If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the `.github` directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the `docs` directory.
